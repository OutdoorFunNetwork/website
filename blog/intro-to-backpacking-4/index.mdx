_Hi there! This is part 4 in a five part series welcoming new hikers to backpacking. Don't forget to check out parts <a href="/blog/intro-to-backpacking-1">1</a>, <a href="/blog/intro-to-backpacking-2">2</a>, and <a href="/blog/intro-to-backpacking-3">3</a> if you haven't already._

## Dress to Unimpress

While hiking and backpacking can be a fashion show filled with garments like $100 pants 
and $400 rain shells, it's likely you already have the outfit you need for your first 
backpacking trip. If it’s easier to know what to avoid we can start there. Leave your 
jeans and favorite hoodie at home. In fact, don’t bring anything made of cotton, 
especially not your socks. Why? Because cotton is heavy and does not dry easily once you 
get it wet. Whether it's sweat or rain, cotton will fail you once it's wet so steer 
towards synthetic materials like polyester. A simple performance shirt that wicks away 
moisture is something you likely already have along with running shorts. Moisture wicking 
outdoor clothing is everywhere from Target to Walmart these days so a pair of moisture 
wicking pants or shorts won’t break the bank at one of those big box outlets the way they 
might at [REI](https://rei.com) or [Backcountry.com](https://backcountry.com). Dress in 
layers and keep comfort and ability to manage moisture as much of a priority as warmth is 
when you choose a mid layer and a shell layer to combat the elements.

Your feet are your number one asset on a backpacking trip so take care of them. Most of 
the time a pair of Gore Tex boots that come over your ankles will be overkill unless you 
expect bad weather and rocky terrain. Some experienced hikers say that a pound on your 
feet equals 5 pounds on your back. This is why lightweight trail runners have become the 
choice footwear of through hikers and weekend warriors alike. Choose footwear that is 
light but provides adequate athletic support, breathable and quick drying, and meets 
your specific needs. Coupled with a good pair of merino wool socks to keep you dry, warm, 
and blister free, your footwear should be considered the most important piece of gear you 
own. Oh, bring a designated pair of “sleep socks”. You’ll thank me for it!

All in all, if you don’t look like a combination of an occasional Planet Fitness member 
and a Cub Scout leader, you’ll be extremely fortunate. The good news is that no one cares 
what you look like so long as they see you in good health and spirit when you get back to 
your car and in the drive through at Burger King after completing your first backpacking trip.

_Things to consider_: What sort of weather can you expect for the area and time of year 
you will be hiking in? Do you really need additional ankle support or waterproof shoes? 
What will you wear to sleep so that you are warm and comfortable? Is the area you are 
hiking in exposed to wind, sun, or prone to thunderstorms or flash flooding?
