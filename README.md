# Outdoor Fun Network â›°

At OFN, our mission is simple. Get outdoors and have fun!

## Requirements

  - [FMS](https://github.com/OutdoorFunNetwork/fms) and its dependencies

## Environment

Make sure you copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update the values!

## The App

### Setup

Make sure you run `npm i` before getting started. Once all the dependencies are installed you'll have access to the following commands:

#### `npm run serve`

Runs the dev server and starts the app at `http://localhost:8080`
_* Make sure you've already got FMS running!_

#### `npm run test:unit`

We're using Jest and Vue Test Utils for our testing. Testing is optional at this stage, but we do recommend checking your work as you go!

#### `npm run lint`

Another optional linting step if you don't have your editor configured to lint your code during development.
